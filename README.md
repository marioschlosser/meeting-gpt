# meeting-gpt
Upload a .wav file to your Google Drive that is a recording of a meeting. The Colab notebook will transcribe it using OpenAI Whisper, identify all speakers using pyannote.audio, and save two csv files: transcript.csv which has all speakers and what they're saying in sequential time, and speakers.csv which has the statistics of who speaks how much (and how fast). You need to give it a huggingface token (get your own on huggingface.co). Add the question you want answered about the meeting and copy and paste transcript.csv into ChatGPT.
